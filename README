Background: 
	Generally on fridays the developers order chinese food for lunch, 
	as a way to bolster fellowship among the team members. In order to get
	everyone's order, someone would have to go around and ask what everyone
	wanted. A website could easily replace this process so that everyone 
	could order their food and the person placing the call can simply open up
	a page to see what everyone wants.

Live Test site: maximx1.myvnc.com:8080/~justin/bearded-adventure

Notes: 
	* "bearded-adventure" is the codename for the project that github had
	     suggested for the project. It sounded cool so we figured on keeping
             it.
	* The live test site is Justin's Personal server.
	* We use github for documenting the development process.
